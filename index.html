	<italic>This is HTML coding and more will be shown below. This website works by being controlled by Github pages.</italic>
	<h1>Description of HTML</h1>
	<P>Basiclly, HTML is a coding language made to create websites such as YouTube, Google and even Github, the page that is being controlled by.</P>
	<p>It is really difficult to master like fonts, images, text and many others out there. But we are on HTML, so what matters about PYTHON or C# ?</p>
	<p>So this website you are on is using HTML, it really depends if the document type of the website. So if this website was a different website coding language, it would NOT be HTML.</p>
	<h1>Examples of HTML</h1>
	<p>You can find out how HTML works on this section of the website, and how hard it is.</p>
	<p>1. Headers</p>
	<p>Headers are controlled with text. Here is an example: <h1></h1> </p>
	<p>Copying that into your HTML document will make a header if you put text between >< .</p>
	<p>2. Text</p>
	<p>Text are usally used as paragraphs, to make websites more exciting. If you put <p></p> in your HTML document, then that will create text/a paragraph if you put text between >< .</p>
	<p>3. Titles</p>
	<p>This is where <head> comes in to place. The code will be shown below:</p>
	<p><head></p>
	<p><title></title></p>
	<p></head></p>
	<h1>Final documents</h1>
	<p>You have learned three things, but you see your website won't work. It is all white on the page, no text, no title, nothing.</p>
	<p>The reason why this is happening is because it hasn't beed identifyed.</p>
	<p>This is the code:</p>
	<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="IaXIg2W"></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
	<p>It should work now, and if not, go to GR/Callum-_-/Issues in the link below.</p>
